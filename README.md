This is the frontend of a survey app. Its purpose is to allow team members to rate surveys. I've added the admin interface in order to allow creating new survey and checking the results of the team member ratings.

You can run this app locally. You'll just have to change the URL endpoints in the code to point to your backend. 
Make sure to adjust the CORS configuration accordingly.

I tried to make it simple to test this application and deployed it.
